The calendar displays US national holidays as well as NASA's Astronomy picture of the day with a short description of the photo underneath, these change daily according to NASA's website. The calendar is fully interactive, you can add as well as save events on certain days, and upon refreshing the page your event will still be saved.

## 4. Roles

Juan Sanchez - Juan demonstrated strong leadership skills throughout the project. He spearheaded the initiative by creating a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation on the first day, providing the vision and idea for the entire calendar. Juan effectively guided the team, ensuring everyone understood their roles and responsibilities, and consistently provided direction and feedback during the development process.
Adriana Herrera - Adriana exhibited exceptional problem-solving abilities by successfully implementing our second API, which initially posed a significant challenge for the team. Despite the complexity of the task, Adriana's dedication and commitment were evident as she worked tirelessly over the weekend to ensure we were prepared for the week ahead. Her determination and technical expertise were instrumental in overcoming obstacles and delivering quality results.
Carolyn Lupi - Carolyn played a vital role in our group as the resource finder. Whenever we required specific links or references, Carolyn took charge and skillfully located the necessary resources. Additionally, she contributed to the project by assisting with CSS styles, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design.
David Harris - David was an invaluable team member who consistently boosted morale. During moments of frustration or when we encountered challenging issues, David's humor and positive attitude provided much-needed levity and motivation. Furthermore, David successfully implemented our second framework, incorporating essential features such as the pointer and social media scroller, enhancing the functionality and user experience of the calendar.
William Roberts- William made contributions to the team with his prior coding knowledge. He offered advice and insights on various aspects of our project, including JavaScript, CSS, and HTML elements. His contributions played a part in shaping our development process.

## 5. Challenges

- In order to connect the NASA api, there is a secret key that the NASA website assigns to you upon signing up, so that’s what Adriana did. Since it’s a private key she created a separate config.js file and added a .gitignore file to hide the configuration key. After doing this she was able to fetch the NASA api. Then she was able to display the NASA picture of the day along with its description.
